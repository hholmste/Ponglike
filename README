A Pong clone made by a guy that never played Pong :(

A couple of remarks: the font for the score is all wrong

It is made with lwjgl, which I haven't bundled, cause I haven't looked into what sort of licencing is necessary, and noone is going to actually play this thing anyway :) (It's a Pong clone, seriously).

It's two-player: left paddle uses 'w' and 's' while right paddle uses 'o' and 'l'

It is the first game I've ever written that is in any state of finished.

It took an hour and a half. Roughly. There are no tests, although I did write one. It turned out to be pointless, though, so I deleted it.
